The program allocates **64 bytes** on the heap using `malloc(64)`, then copies the contents of `argv[1]` into this allocated memory using `strcpy`. Additionally, another heap allocation (`malloc(4)`) is made to store a function pointer, which points to a function `m()`. This function, however, only calls `puts()` and does nothing useful.  

The program **calls the function stored in the second malloc'd buffer** (which initially points to `m()`), but this can be exploited.  

### Breakdown of the Call:
1. **Heap Allocation:**  
   - `malloc(64)`, storing its pointer at `0x1c(%esp)`.  
   - `malloc(4)`, storing its pointer at `0x18(%esp)`.  

2. **Function Pointer Setup:**  
   - `0x8048468` (which is `m()`) is stored inside the second allocated buffer (`0x18(%esp)`).  

3. **Copying User Input:**  
   - `strcpy(argv[1], malloc(64))` â†’ This allows a buffer overflow if `argv[1]` is larger than 64 bytes.  

4. **Function Call via Indirect Pointer:**  
   - The program **loads the function pointer from the heap** (`mov (%eax), %eax`).  
   - It **calls the function stored there** (`call *%eax`).  

### Exploit Opportunity:  

If we **overwrite the function pointer stored in `0x18(%esp)`** with the address of `n()`, we can execute it instead of `m()`. Since `n()` contains a call to `system()`, this can be leveraged for command execution.
However, there is another function, `n()`, which contains a call to `system()`, but it is **never directly called** in the program.  

Our goal is to **exploit the heap allocation** and modify the function pointer so that when `m()` is supposed to execute, it instead **calls `n()`**, giving us control over execution.

strcpy does not check for the destination buffer size, meaning if the source string is larger than the destination buffer, it overwrites adjacent memory.
